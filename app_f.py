#If another program is already using port 5000, youâ€™ll see OSError: [Errno 98] or OSError: [WinError 10013] when the server tries to start.

#The (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) elements shown in the URL map are the request methods that are handled by the routes.
#The HTTP specification
#The three routes to the url map are attached to the GET method, which is used when the client whants to request for  information.

#view: A view function is the code you write to respond to requests to your application.
#Decorator: Because each view in Flask is a function, decorators can be used to inject additional functionality to one or more functions.
#Blueprint: A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code.Flaskr will have two blueprints, one for authentication functions and one for the blog posts functions.
#Route: Decorate a view function to register it with the given URL rule and options. Calls add_url_rule(), which has more details about the implementation.
#handler: is a routine/function/method which is specialized in a certain type of data or focused on certain special tasks.
	#Event Handler: receives and digests events and signals from the surrounding system (e.g. OS or GUI)
	#Memory handler: performs certain special tasks on memory.
	#File input handler -  function receiving file input and performing special tasks on the data, all depending on context of course.
#Contexts: this are meant to provide certain data that the view function needs in order to fulfill the request
		#contexts enable flask to make certain variables globally accesible to a thread without interferring ith the other threads.

	#Flask pushes the application and request context before dispatching a request to the application, and removes them after
	# the request is handled. When the application is pushed the current_app and g value become available to the thread.

"""For older version of flask the
if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run()
In recent versions of flask this instance is substituted by  flask run command in the command line.
